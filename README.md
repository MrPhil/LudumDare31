My from Scratch Engine using SDL2 and C/C++. It is incomplete, and unplayable, but I did accomplish the following features: 
- Handle Input from Mouse, Keyboard, and Controllers 
- Hardware Accelerated, Rectangle Sprites 
- Loading images from disk 
- Delta time calculated movement 
- Box Colliders (basic, just the sprite Rectangle) 
- Super simple Physics (not finished)
